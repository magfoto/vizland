The Visualization Project allows the exploration of 60 common data visualization types, their descriptions, and examples of use.  The project is a web prototype that is to act as a learning tool and satisfy the need to query visualization types, more specifically, their functions, interactively.

This file documents the development and experimentation process behind the prototype.  To be a learning tool in the OCAD University Visual Analytics Lab, it will experience further experimentation by graduate students and researchers in our quest for knowledge and analysis of data visualization methods.
